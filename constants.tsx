    description: "An AI‑powered resource finder that helps people in Toronto locate nearby food banks, shelters, and community services by typing natural‑language requests.",
    detailedDescription: "Nov 2025 — Won 1st Place at ElleHacks for concept + implementation. The app converts free‑form questions (e.g., ‘I need food near Yonge & Bloor’) into structured intents using the Gemini API, then geocodes and ranks resources with OpenStreetMap/Leaflet before rendering routes and options on an accessible map UI. Built with React + Tailwind for a responsive experience and engineered with an offline‑aware cache so critical data remains available on spotty networks. Planned enhancements include real‑time update feeds and multi‑language support for broader accessibility.",

Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, the app uses SSR/ISR for product pages to balance freshness with speed, plus a scoped client‑side cart for snappy interactions. The UI follows accessible patterns and a consistent design system. Deployed on Vercel for global edge caching, low latency, and auto‑scaling. Performance budgets and monitoring keep the experience responsive as the catalog grows.",

The Flask backend schedules ingestion and normalizes data into SQLite, exposing a small REST API. The frontend presents open vs. occupied lots and historical capacity trends with Chart.js.
